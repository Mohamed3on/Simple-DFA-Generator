This is a simple DFA Generator, given the language, states, initial & final states and transitions. The 2 example problems provided are: 1- Given the Alphabet {𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐} write a computer program in Java or C++ to construct a DFA which accepts: (𝑎|𝑏|𝑐) ∗ 𝑐. Set of strings of a’s, b’s and c’s ending with the string c. 2- Given the Alphabet {𝑎, 𝑏} write a computer program in Java or C++ to construct a DFA for the following language: (𝑎 + 𝑏) ∗𝑎𝑏𝑏. Set of strings of a’s and b’s ending with the string abb, So L = {abb, aabb, babb, aaabb, ababb, ………….} You can add more examples in the Main file, and run them.
